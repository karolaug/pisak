def get_resolution():#for use only if PySide is not in use, it's there already
    ''' Checks current screen resolution

    Only to be used in Linux and when PySide is not in use, as there
    the size of the screen can be queried from
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv) with
    app.dektop().screenGeometry().

    Function uses Linux command "xrandr" to query the system about current
    resoulution.

    Returns
    --------
    size : tuple of ints (width, height)
        size of screen in pixels

    rad : int
        radius of the biggest circle that will be drawn
    
    Returns
    --------
    coordinates : tuples
        coordinates of nine places where the circles will be drawn
