def lookForCameras():
    ''' Function looks for cameras available cameras.

    Returns
    --------
    dic : {Camera_i , index}
        where i is the 1,2,3 etc. and index
        is an int corresponding to the camera that should be passed on
        to cv2.VideoCapture or to class Camera from eyetracker.camera.camera.

class Camera(object):

    Class governing the communication with the camera.

    Parameters
    -----------
    camera : int
        the index of the camera, best taken from func lookForCameras,
        from eyetracker.camera.capture
    dic : dic{propID  value}
        to check corresponding propIDs check
        opencv documentation under the term VideoCapture. 
        They will be set in the moment of object creation.

    --------
