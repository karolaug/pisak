def drawGlint(image , where_pupil , numberOfGlints):
    ''' Find and draw glint on image.

    Function takes an image, converts it to grayscale if it is not,
    detects glint and draws it on a new image.

    Parameters
    -----------
    image : np.array
        image where the glint is to be detected
    where_pupil : np.array
        coordinates of pupil on a given image
    numberOfGlints : int
        number of points to find on an image

    Returns
    --------
    color image : np.array
        returns a numpy array in a bgr scale with the glint
        marked in blue

def drawPupil(image, thres):
    ''' Find and draw pupil on image.

    Function takes an image, applies 'trunc' threshold(cv2.THRESH_TRUNC),
    detects pupil and draws it on a new image.

    Parameters
    -----------
    image : np.array
        image where the pupil is to be detected
    thres : int
        value of the threshold

    Returns
    --------
    cimage : np.array
        returns a numpy array in a bgr scale with the pupil
        marked in red

def displayImage(image, where='new'):
    ''' Display image in new or existing window.

    Function displays the image in a new window or in the pointed window.
    Returns the displayed image as a numpy array.

    Parameters
    -----------
    image : np.array
        numpy array being an image to be displayed
    where : string
        name of the window as string in which the image is to be
        displayed, not providing the name will create a new one

    Returns
    -----------
    image : np.array
        ddisplayed image.
